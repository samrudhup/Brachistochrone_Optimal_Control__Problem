# Brachistochrone_Optimal_Control__Problem
The Brachistochrone problem is a classical control problem to find the fastest descent between two point by finding the brachistochrone curve of fastest descent. The point mass is supposed to slide though the curve without friction and under the constant influence of gravitational force to a fixed end point in the shortest time.
